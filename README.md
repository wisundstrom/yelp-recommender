# Recommending Businesses on Yelp 
This project looks at and evaulates some different recommendation strategies for matching users with business on Yelp

## Summary
In this project I created a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database on AWS to store data from the [Yelp Challege](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge) dataset. I then used python and the cypher query language to make a simple graph based recomendation algorith and compare the performance of that algorithm to some standard recmmendation models. I used the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) python package to train and test the standard models.
